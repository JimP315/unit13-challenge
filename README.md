Unit 13 Boot Camp homework
## Tried many times to get the lambda to work - seemed to show with the various testing that the error coding worked and the errors i got I fixed, so not really sure why the lambda errored all the time and noone could really assist on the slack help sites 
## Also could get the slot visuals to come up, and tried two different types of coding for the eventual Investment recommendations, seemed that  the only thing that worked at one poitn was that the recommendation showed that it would recommend the last Recc of 0% bonds and 100% equities, but that seemed a fluke
## Would really really like to recycle back to this since this is related to the business solutions I am trying to come up with.
